## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project is a straightforward implementation of the CloudWeather App. It consists of static web pages styled using CSS and incorporates JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather API and display it on the user interface.

To run the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
